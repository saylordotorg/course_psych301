**Unit 6: Interpersonal Relationships and Attraction** <span
id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, we will focus on the psychology of individuals in terms
of how they are attracted to one another and how they form
relationships. While the relationships we will discuss are typically
romantic in nature, many of the same concepts can be applied to
friendships and family relationships as well. We will be primarily
concerned with how relationships differ and why some relationships last
longer than others. These issues become quite complex when you consider
the diversity of the human relationships that exist. Accordingly,
psychologists have developed a number of theories that attempt to
explain different aspects of relationships. This unit will also look at
physical attraction, identifying different types of attraction (i.e.
physical and aesthetic) and why attraction is an important part of human
survival.*

**6.2.2 Attachment Theory** <span id="6.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This material discusses adult attachments styles and how they
relate to romantic relationships. Attachment theory first was researched
with respect to infants and their mothers. The nature and quality of the
infant’s attachment to the parent is presumed to provide a working model
for relationships in general. To the extent that this model remains
stable over the years it might influence how adults approach their
romantic relationships. The four primary adult attachment styles (one
secure and three insecure) are described in detail.*
