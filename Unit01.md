    just common sense, but sometimes the results are surprising. Find
    out more about some of the topics that people think are common sense
    by taking a short true/false assessment and then checking your
    answers against the answer key. To take the assessment, scroll down
    to Table 1.1, on pages 31-32. Record your answers to the 8-question
    true/false quiz. After, scroll down to Table 1.5, on page 55-56, to
    go to the Chapter Summary page where you can check how well you
    scored and read more about the research supporting the correct
    answers. By doing this exercise, you should gain a better
    understanding of the importance of conducting scientific research,
    even if the focus of a study seems to be a simple matter of common
    sense.
