**Unit 7: Aggression and Helping** <span id="7"></span> 
*This unit will examine the contrasting acts of aggression and helping.
We will explore the theories, research methods, and research findings
related to the study of aggression. Then we will switch from studying
when and why people cause harm to others to evaluating when and why they
are willing to help others. Specifically, we will look at situations in
which people are more or less likely to help others, the reasoning
behind helping, and the individual difference variables that affect the
act of helping.*
