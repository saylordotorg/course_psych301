**Unit 2: The Self and Person Perception** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will focus on two areas of social psychology that may seem
somewhat out of place in a class about groups, cultures, and societies:
the self and its perception of others. You may be wondering how units on
the individual self fit into this course. Well, when we talk about
social situations from a psychological point of view, there are two
components of any interaction. The first part, which relates to the
self, is the way we view ourselves and our beliefs. Our concept of our
own being is important to understanding how we act in social situations.
The second component of any interaction involves how we perceive and
form opinions or ideas about people around us. This may be more obvious
in how it relates to our interaction in social situations, as our
opinions about people may change the way in which we interact with them.
Understanding how we view ourselves and how we view other people is
essential in being able to comprehend how humans behave in social
situations.*
