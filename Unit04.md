**Unit 4: Social Influence** <span id="4"></span> 
*As social beings, we are often strongly affected by the presence of
those around us. One main focus of social psychological research has
centered on social influence. Social influence refers to a situation in
which a person or group changes or influences the attitudes or behaviors
of others in a particular direction. There are many different aspects of
social influence that one can experience at any given time. However, in
this unit, we will focus on four types of influences that humans
experience when in social situations: conformity, compliance, obedience,
and the bystander effect.*
