This course will introduce you to the concepts and ideas in the area of
social psychology. Social Psychology aims to discover the different ways
in which people interact with other individuals, groups, and the larger
society as a whole, as well as why people act in certain ways. As with
an anthropology or sociology course, social psychology looks at the
inner workings of groups of people. However, it differs from these
courses in terms of its focus; social psychology focuses primarily on
the single individual’s psychology as part of the group or society,
rather than the culture or group interaction (though both of these areas
have some relevance in social psychology). This may seem to be quite a
broad subject area – and it is. Humans are social creatures (in other
words, they have evolved to be able to interact and communicate at high
levels with individuals of their own species) and almost invariably
exist in a social context (even a situation in which society is absent
could be studied by social psychologists as a social context). Social
psychology deals with a huge range of aspects of human life, including
love, attraction, aggression, helping behaviors (or altruism), and
obedience. While social psychology encompasses a multitude of topics, it
also relates to many other fields, both within psychology and outside of
it. For example, other branches of psychology (personality, gender,
culture, emotions, clinical, and industrial psychology) have used
important findings from social psychology in their own studies. Subjects
outside of psychology, such as religion, economics, and even
engineering, have made use of information that has come out of social
psychology research. Social psychology research has undoubtedly had the
greatest impact on the field of psychology as a whole. This course will
introduce you to the most influential social psychology experiments and
explain the impact that they have had on the field as a whole. First, we
will introduce you to the broad topic of social psychology. Next, we
will get into the content areas in which social psychological research
is conducted. These areas will include the research, findings, and
theories regarding self and person perceptions, attitudes, social
influence, prejudice and discrimination, interpersonal relationships,
aggression, and altruism, in addition to applications of social
psychology to health, law, businesses, and the environment.

free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   YouTube: University of California, Berkeley: Professor Robb
    Willer’s *[Saylor PSYCH301 Lecture
    Series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAB96655B896FF018)*
-   University of Idaho: Traci Craig’s *[Social Psychology
    Lessons](http://www.class.uidaho.edu/psyc320/schedule.htm)*
-   *[Principles of Social
    Psychology](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Social%20Psychology.pdf)*
-   Psych Web: Russ Dewey’s *[Psychology: An
    Introduction](http://www.intropsych.com/index.html)*

   
 **Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory materials presented in the
latter units. You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources provided in each unit.  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of 74
hours.Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of time
you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you plan
your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these time
advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 5.75 hours. Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 4.25 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (a total of 1.5 hours)
on Tuesday night; etc.
