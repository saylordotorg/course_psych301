**Unit 5: Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination** <span
id="5"></span> 
*One of the negative effects of social influence is prejudice, which is
an adverse prejudgment or bias of an individual or group seen in almost
every society and within most people, at one time or another.
Accordingly, it is important to know how prejudiced attitudes develop
and why we tend to exhibit them. It is also important to understand the
steps one can take to reduce prejudice. This unit will explore the ways
in which stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination relate to one
another, while explaining their theoretical origins and utility.*

     Instructions: Note this article will cover subunits 5.2 and 5.3.
    Read this empirical journal article as advised by the readings
    presented previously in subunit 1.2 of this course. This article
    speaks to the impact of social context, including social norms, on
    stereotyping. Be careful not to generalize these results without
    appreciating that there are more within group differences (which
    represent differences between individuals within a single group)
    than between group differences (which represent differences between
    groups). In other words, do not use these results to form a
    stereotype of different majors.

    important, yet distinct, phenomena. Note that a self-fulfilling
    prophecy is when someone else’s expectations of an individual are
    conveyed in subtle ways, leading the individual to confirm the other
    person’s original expectations.
