**Unit 3: Attitude and Attitude Change** <span id="3"></span> 
*Attitudes are an essential component of our psychological world. We
evaluate items every day in terms of* good *and* bad *or* like *and*
dislike*, and it is through these evaluations that we make sense of our
world. Importantly, attitudes are not fixed and are subject to change
with experience. For these reasons, attitudes have occupied a central
place in the field of social psychology. In this unit, you will learn
about what attitudes are and the important concept of cognitive
dissonance, which is associated with attitude change.*
